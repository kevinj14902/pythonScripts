## Python Scripts

A collection of various simple python scripts to automate certain activities that I find myself doing often.

## Currently Included Scripts
- File Organizer: Organizes files in a folder into seperate folders based on file type, e.g. pdf, mp4, png. If a folder for a certain file type doesn't exist, the script will create a new folder for that file type.

- Youtube Video Downloader: Downloads youtube videos to a specified file path. Enter the video you want to download in the url variable, and the file path for where you want the video to go. You can also download it as an mp3 by making mp3=True.

- Video to Gif Converter: Converts a video like mp4 to a gif. To use it, place video file in the same folder as the script. Enter video file name in VideoFileClip. The name of your gif can also be chosen in clip.write_gif, and fps of gif can also be changed. Then run the script and a gif of the video will be created in the same folder.
