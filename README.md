## Python Scripts

A collection of various simple python scripts to automate certain activities that I find myself doing often.

## Currently Included Scripts
- File Organizer: Organizes files in a folder into seperate folders based on file type, e.g. pdf, mp4, png. If a folder for a certain file type doesn't exist, the script will create a new folder for that file type.

- Youtube Video Downloader: Downloads youtube videos to a specified file path. Run the program and input py youtubeDownloader.py "youtube video link" to download.
